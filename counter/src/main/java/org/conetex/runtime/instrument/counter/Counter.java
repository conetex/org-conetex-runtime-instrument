    /**
     * Increments the counter. This method is designed to track and count costs in the
     * program by increasing the counter value in a thread-safe manner. If the current counter
     * reaches its maximum value, a new counter instance is created and linked to the previous one.
     * Key implementation details:
     * - This method does not use or depend on any external classes or methods outside this class,
     *   except for Java primitives and `synchronized`, which are part of the core language.
     * - All operations are performed only with primitive types (e.g., `long`, `boolean`) or
     *   internal class references (e.g., `head`, `previousCounter`), ensuring independence from
     *   any potentially instrumented classes.
     * - A safeguard (`isInProgress`) is implemented to detect and prevent recursive calls,
     *   which avoids endless recursion and ensures the integrity of the counter state.
     * As a result, this method is safe to use in instrumented environments, as it avoids any
     * circular calls or interference caused by instrumented classes or dependencies.
